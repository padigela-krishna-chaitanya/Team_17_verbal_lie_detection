VERBAL LIE DETECTION:

There are three python implementation files in the project the files called "experiment_1.ipynb" and "experiment_2_and_3.ipynb" are not final models they are just experiments before making the final model. And the dataset used in "experiment_1.ipynb" is not provided since its not a significant value dataset.

The python execution file called "final_model.ipynb" is the final model of our project verbal lie detection.

The project is implemented in google colab environment. Before implementing the code make sure the dataset is uploaded to your google drive and change the dataset file location in the code.

The dataset is also provided "deceptive-opinion.csv"
